# Car On Roof â€“ Three.js + Cannon Sample

This is a sample project that uses Three.js, Cannon and PlayroomKit to create an isometric car game. The car physics and model are from [Bruno Simon's website](https://bruno-simon.com/).

**Note:** The code for loading model is in `src/carmodel.js`, this also applies basic materials to the model. You can also replace `loadCar` import with one in `src/carmodel_basic.js` to see a dummy car model with box and torus shape instead of the actual car model.

## What's Included

- A basic car model with car physics
- Uses PlayroomKit's [Joystick](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/multiplayer/joystick) component for touch controls
- A simple isometric scene with a few spheres on the ground
- Very basic networked physics using [PlayroomKit](https://docs.joinplayroom.com)
## Demo
